# USB-Relay-Lighting-Project
USB relay lighting project to automate home lighting

I built this project to automate my room lighting using the USB port on my home theater receiver. When the receiver powers on, it outputs 5V through USB, which triggers a relay to power a connected strip of room lights. It's a simple, reliable way to add ambient lighting without needing any smart home apps or cloud services. Just plug in, power on, and the lights follow. This setup uses a 5V relay, some basic AC wiring, and a bit of clever automation â€” perfect for anyone wanting a hands-on intro to home automation.
